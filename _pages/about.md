Welcome! I am a developer applying Continuous Integration (CI) and natural language processing techniques in Fintech business contexts.
I am also an affiliated researcher and research collaborator with the [Software Engineering Research Lab](https://www.bth.se/forskning/forskningsomraden/programvaruteknik/sert/) at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se).
